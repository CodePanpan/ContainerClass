2.) Teams: dacoit is on mafias' team. Rest all are in another team. God conducts the game and knows everything
3.) Mafias can kill 1 person at night. 
4.) Healer can kill 1 person and save 1 throughout the game.
5.) Detetive is allowed to suspect a person for mafia for each night to which he/she would get a yes/no response
6.) Dacoit can kill a person he/she might suspect to be a non-mafia during the day
7.) During the day discussions would happen where each person explains why he/she is not a mafia. 
8.) Then a vote out happens in which a person is voted out. Then the night starts again.
9.) Game ends when all mafias or citizens are killed. Winner is the surviving team.

Classes:
1.) All the classes are self explanatory. Manager classes would manage a process, e.g: VotingMgr facilitates the voting process
2.) Other classes contains the corresponding attributes of mafia, etc.
3.) When the code is run it would at present ask the name of all the players. Then the game progress automatically.
